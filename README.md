# Indra

A proof-of-concept database-library with the following features:

* PHP class generation for types, attributes, and models
* Multiple inheritance: an object may have multiple types, without naming conflicts
* Versioning: all revisions on the data are stored permanently and may be reverted.

The library makes use of a standard MySQL database.
